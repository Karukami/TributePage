						He's a game director and designer, best known as the creator of Nintendo's <strong>Kirby</strong> and <strong>Super Smash Bros.</strong> series. Sakurai's earliest experience in the video game industry began when he worked for <strong>HAL Laboratory</strong>, where he created Kirby at age 19 and directed his first title, Kirby's Dream Land. He left HAL on August 5, 2003, growing tired of being passively forced to make sequels, since he understands that lots of people have to give their all to make a game possible.
					</p>

					<p>
						On September 30, 2005, Sakurai announced that he had formed his own company, <strong>Sora Co. Ltd.</strong> In february 2013, he was diagnosed with <em>calcific tendinitis</em> near his right shoulder, which caused him pain whenever he moved his arm. He mentioned that this could slow down his work, as he does some game testing himself. His wife, Michiko, has worked on the graphical user interface for many of his games, including <strong>Kirby's Air Ride</strong>, <strong>Meteos</strong>, and the <strong>Super Smash Bros.</strong> series.
					</p>
					<p>
						In a January 2015 column in Weekly Famitsu, Sakurai allured to the possibility of retirement, doubting if he would be able to continue making games if his career continued to be as stressful as it was. However, on March 8, 2018, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate was announced, which he would be directing.
